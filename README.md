# Resume

This is a simple android application that can be used to track a car using any type of android mobile phone.

# Why I decided to create this app ?

For the applications that I've tested, I found out that they didn't provide some features that I would like to see in
an GPS car tracker application, and also was too complicated to work on.

# Requirements
* Android 2.1+
